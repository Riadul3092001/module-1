    <p><strong>Intel</strong> Corporation, commonly known as Intel, is an American multinational corporation and
        technology company headquartered in <strong>Santa Clara, California.</strong> It is the world's largest
        semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue, and is one of the developers of the x86 series of instruction sets,
        the instruction sets found in most personal computers (PCs). Incorporated in Delaware, Intel ranked No. <strong>
            45</strong> in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue for
        nearly a decade, from 2007 to 2016 fiscal years.

        Intel supplies microprocessors for computer system manufacturers such as Acer, Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Intel also
        manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics
        chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.

        Intel (integrated and electronics) was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Gordon Moore (of
        Moore's law) and Robert Noyce (1927â€“1990), and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew
        Grove. Intel was a key component of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high-tech center. Noyce was a key inventor
        of the integrated circuit (microchip). Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which
        represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial
        microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its
        primary business.

        During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the
        computer industry. During this period, Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was
        known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against
        Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC
        industry.

        The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, and supports other open-source
        projects such as Wayland, Mesa, Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.</p>
